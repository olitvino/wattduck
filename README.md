# wattduck
A watt usage indicator extension for the gnome-shell

## about
wattduck provides a simple indicator for battery power usage to the gnome-shell status bar.
It aims to be fast, efficient, simple and clean.
wattduck works by asynchronously polling `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/power_now` and has been tested
under archlinux and manjaro.
